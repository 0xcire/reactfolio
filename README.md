## Built with:

- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

- TypeScript / Zod
- React / React Router / React Hook Form
- Vitest / Jest / React Testing Library
- - Github Actions to Netlify

### process

After taking some extra time reacclimating myself with Vanilla JS / CSS, I decided to jump straight into a more modern workflow.

As someone who has been stuck in tutorial hell before, I tried avoiding them and just learning via docs and etc. I think my extra time spent with the underlying languages helped not feel so overwhelmed and pick up how abstractions are implemented, but there are probably some holes I need to go back and fill. Especially with TypeScript.

### issues?

Definitely would have benefitted from a more robust CI CD pipeline for testing. Certain features like mobile viewport values, testing connection to Netlify Forms would have gone much smoother.

Testing was surprisingly hard to get right.

I'm atrocious at picking colors.

Probably have some holes I need to fill with TypeScript and React and will take some courses alongside [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) while building, to tie everything together.
