# [My Portfolio Website](https://ecfolio.netlify.app/)

## Built with:

- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- TypeScript / Zod
- React / React Router / React Hook Form
- Vitest / Jest / React Testing Library
- Github Actions -> Netlify
- ESLint

## Learning Points

- Differences and benefits using TypeScript
- React, implementing base functionality of something like Headless UI from scratch
- Creating various animations / page transitions with Framer Motion
- Setting up forms with Netlify, validating data with Zod, utilizing toasts to notify users of success/error
- Creating basic implementation tests using vitest/jest and react testing library
- Creating a minimal CI/CD pipeline

## Successes?

Picking up Tailwind, TypeScript, React was not very difficult due to the time spent getting comfortable with CSS and JS. Just building things and learning via docs and googling has been the most effective learning method for me so far.

## issues?

Definitely would have benefitted from a more robust CI CD pipeline for testing. Certain features like quirky mobile viewport values, testing connection to Netlify Forms would have gone much smoother.

Some lack of understanding of react testing library led to some bugs that should have gone much smoother. At least I know what to do going forward now.

I'm atrocious at picking colors. Excited to work with teams in the future where designs are handled so I can focus on the implementation.
